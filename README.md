LocalTransfer is an open-source desktop application designed to make file sharing across devices simple and straightforward.

- **Fast File Sharing**: Share files across your network quickly and easily without relying on external online tools.
- **Instant Access**: Instantly generate a link or QR code to share files with other devices. Simply open the link or scan the QR code on the receiving device to start the downloadâ€”no installation required.
- **User-Friendly**: A simple and intuitive interface that makes file sharing straightforward for everyone.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with all major operating systems, ensuring that you can share files regardless of the device you're using.
- **Size Limits?**: More or less 4.2GB per transfer. I'm planning to improve this and increase the upload limit

This application is currently in development. You might experience some minor bugs.
